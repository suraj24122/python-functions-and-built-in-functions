# python-functions-and-built-in-functions
Here are some programs demonstrate the functions and built in functions in python
This repository contains a collection of simple Python programs that demonstrate various basic programming concepts and built-in functions.

Programs List
program_1.py

Description: Adds two numbers.

Usage: Demonstrates a basic function to perform addition.

Output: addition of a and b is = 7

program_2.py

Description: Checks if a number is even or odd.

Usage: Uses the modulo operator to determine parity.

Output: Result = False

program_3.py

Description: Calculates the factorial of a given number.

Usage: Uses a loop to compute the factorial.

Output: 120 (for input 5)

program_4.py

Description: Checks if a number is prime.

Usage: Takes user input and uses a loop to check divisibility.

Note: The program has logical errors (e.g., temp+1 and a+1 should be temp += 1 and a += 1).

program_5.py

Description: Finds the frequency of a digit in a number.

Usage: Takes user input and counts digit occurrences.

Note: The program has logical errors (e.g., count+1 should be count += 1 and n = n / 10 should be n = n // 10).

program_6.py

Description: Checks if a string is a palindrome.

Usage: Compares the string with its reverse.

Output:
is palindrome = True (for "MadaM")
is palindrome = False (for "Suns")

program_7.py

Description: Finds the maximum of three numbers.

Usage: Uses the built-in max function.

Output: 3 (for inputs 1, 2, 3)

program_8.py

Description: Demonstrates various built-in functions.

Usage: Includes examples of upper(), sorted(), len(), sum(), max(), min(), and round().

Output:

HELLO

sorted Number = [1, 2, 3, 4]

6 (length of "python")

9 (length of the list)

19 (sum of nums)

9 (max of nums)

1 (min of nums)

3.15 (rounded value of 3.1456786)

How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the repository directory:

bash
cd <repository-name>
Run any program using Python:

bash
python program_X.py
Notes
Some programs (e.g., program_4.py and program_5.py) contain logical errors that need to be fixed for correct functionality.

The programs are designed for educational purposes and demonstrate basic Python concepts.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use these programs as learning tools!
